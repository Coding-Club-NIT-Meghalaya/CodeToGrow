Reema goes to a party where she takes N lottery tickets, the tickets can be taked for free but each of them have a number written on it
(if it's positive then person gets money and for negative the person gives money). Her mother is very worried of her spending too much of money, 
so she made an array Ar of size N , where Ai contains the amount Reema gained or lost in a lottery ticket and asked Reema to puta ll negative numbers
to the beginning of the array and positive to end of array.

Reema could not do it without taking constant extra space, help her solving it out with constant space.

Note:

The order of rearrnging can be any eg.(-1, -2, 3, 5) or (-2, -1, 5, 3 ) or (-1, -2, 5, 3 ) or (-2, -1, 3, 5)
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer N the size of array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,.....AN.

Output:
Print Ar such that begining contains negative and end contins positive numbers.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000
-1,000,000 ≤ Ai ≤ 1,000,000

Example:

Input:
9
-12 11 -13 -5 6 -7 5 -3 11

output:
-12 -3 -13 -5 -7 6 5 11 11
