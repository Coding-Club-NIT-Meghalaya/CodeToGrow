# Sorting Algorithms

## - **Quick sort**
[Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

### *Time Complexity*
 - Best-case analysis := O(*n*)
 - Average-case analysis := O(*n*log*n*)
 - Worst-case analysic := O($n^2$)
